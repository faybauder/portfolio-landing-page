    <h2><span class="about">About me</span></h2>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find out the basics of who I am, how I work, and why I am doing what I'm doing. I am currently going to school at <strong>Epicodus</strong> to become a computer programmer. I am insterested in front end programming, and making things look nice using code. I go to school part time and work as a barber full time. My schedule is very busy but I am very determined to keep pushing through to make coding my full time career.</p>
