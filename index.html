  <h2><span class="about">About me</span></h2>

  <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find out the basics of who I am, how I work, and why I am doing what I'm doing. I am currently going to school at Epicods to become a computer programmer. Currently I am insterested in front end and making things look nice using code. I go to school part time and work as a barber full time. My schedule is very busy but I am very determined to keep pushing through to make coding my full time career.</p>

  <h3><span class="projects">Projects</span></h3>
  <p>Here are a few of my first projects I have worked on and created. As I am just getting down the basics of code now, I am hoping to one day look back on these and have a good laugh.</p>
